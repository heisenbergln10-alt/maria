        <article class="essay-content">
    <p class="essay-paragraph first-paragraph"><span class="drop-cap">T</span>he Case for Moral Realism: Addressing Moral Skepticism</p>
    <p class="essay-paragraph">What would it take for there to be such a thing as morality? What exactly would need to be the case for it to be correct to say that there are objective facts about right and wrong, objective moral truths about what we are morally required to do?</p>
    <p class="essay-paragraph">People disagree about this fundamental question. It isn't merely that they disagree about what the particular moral facts are. Nor is it merely the case that they disagree about whether there are any moral facts at all. They disagree as well about what would need to be true for it to be appropriate to say that there were moral facts, what would have to be the case for there to be something that genuinely deserved to be called "morality," or "objective moral truth. "</p>
    <p class="essay-paragraph">Still, suppose there were a rule or perhaps a set of principles that required certain actions, while forbidding still others. Suppose that it was possible for us to figure out the contents of those rules, and that in principle at least we could guide ourselves by them, trying to do the actions that were required and to avoid those acts that were forbidden. Suppose that it was possible to know not only what the principles were ( in a general way ) but also how they applied to particular cases, so that although people might disagree about any of these matters, there were objective answers about who was right, correct views about what was actually required, and so on.</p>
    <p class="essay-paragraph">Suppose that, although the principles sometimes generated different specific requirements in different circumstances, the same basic principles applied to everyone. They were equally binding on everyone, no matter what the given person's particular group or society. What's more, suppose that having figured out what one was required to do, whether generally or in particular instances, one would then be moved by those beliefs, so that one was always motivated, at least somewhat, to act in keeping with what one took to be the various requirements and prohibitions.</p>
    <p class="essay-paragraph">And suppose as well that there was always at least some justification for doing this, that the requirements were backed by reasons, perhaps even of a categorical sort. Finally, suppose that what these various principles required of us were different ways of protecting and promoting the interests of oneself and others, along with ways of showing everyone due respect.</p>
    <p class="essay-paragraph">If all of this were true, if there really were principles with all of these features, almost all of us would readily agree that these principles were moral principles, and that all of this constituted something worthy of being called an objective morality. A list of the relevant rules would be an objective moral code, and the various facts about what the principles required of us ( or permitted, and so on ) would be objective moral facts. There would be objective moral truths.</p>
    <p class="essay-paragraph">Of course, some might think it a mistake to emphasize rules and principles, as described above, with their corresponding focus on actions as being permitted, required, or forbidden. They might think it preferable to focus instead on virtues and vices, with objective facts about what sort of person one should be, positing as well the existence of reasons and motivation to act and think and feel as the virtuous person would act and think and feel, and so on. But for present purposes this would be to quibble over details.</p>
    <p class="essay-paragraph">Presumably, if it really were the case that certain character traits were objectively preferable, so that one had reason to be such a person and to deliberate and act accordingly, and so on, then here too it would be appropriate to talk about the existence of an objective morality with corresponding moral facts. ( For simplicity of exposition, however, this discussion will continue to focus primarily on rules and principles. )</p>
    <p class="essay-paragraph">Admittedly, some might ask for more. Perhaps some would want to be assured that the basic principles are not merely universally binding in the actual world, but necessary truths, holding in all possible worlds. Or perhaps they will want to be assured that the validity of these rules, what makes them binding, is essentially a mind independent affair, or that the reasons justifying conformity to the principles are sufficiently strong to always override any competing considerations. And so on.</p>
    <p class="essay-paragraph">People disagree about what precisely would need to be the case for it to be appropriate to affirm that there really is such a thing as morality ( or objective moral truth ) . So no single list of features like this is likely to satisfy everyone. ( And for that matter, of course, many people would be satisfied with somewhat less than what has just been described. ) Still, there is a cluster of features ( if not exactly the list given, then something in the neighborhood ) that would satisfy all or almost all of us. If there really were requirements ( and prohibitions, and so on ) more or less of the sort described, then the moral realist would be vindicated. There would be such a thing as objective morality. There would be moral facts.</p>
    <p class="essay-paragraph">To which the moral skeptic will of course respond: That's all well and good, but what of it? The question was never whether we could describe something, such that if only it were to exist, it would constitute objective morality, but only whether such a thing actually exists. We might well agree that if something like the story just told were true ( putting aside questions about which precise features of the story are essential ) , then the moral realist would be right, and moral facts really would exist. But again, what of it?</p>
    <p class="essay-paragraph">There is no good reason to believe that anything remotely like this really is the case. And there is, in fact, plenty of reason to think that it might even be true that nothing like this could be the case. Indeed, describing in detail just what it would take for there to be such a thing as morality makes it all the easier to see why we are right to deny the existence of moral facts. There is compelling reason to believe that the moral realist's picture ( whatever the precise details ) simply does not correspond to reality. To believe in morality is to believe in a fiction.</p>
    <p class="essay-paragraph">Few, if any, of us are altogether immune to the moral skeptic's taunts. Even if we find ourselves thinking that skepticism is misguided and that there really is such a thing as morality, it is easy to fall prey to the thought that belief in morality is a less than fully respectable matter, that there is something intellectually suspect or second rate about believing in the reality of moral facts. At the very least, we may still worry about how best to respond to the skeptic's specific challenges, wondering whether there really are compelling answers to their objections, and if so, what those answers might look like.</p>
    <p class="essay-paragraph">That's why it is important to take the skeptic's challenge seriously. Each of us should want to see whether plausible answers to the skeptic can be given. But doing this, of course, requires moving beyond vague skeptical worries to the effect that there is something or the other implausible about the moral realist's position. Rather, answering the skeptic requires that we spell out and pin down specific criticisms, separating each one from the next, so as to hold them all up to the light and subject them, each in turn, to critical scrutiny.</p>
    <p class="essay-paragraph">We need to see exactly what it is that might trouble someone about accepting the realist's position. If there are features of realism that are problematic, what exactly are they? If there are reasons to think that belief in the existence of moral facts is a less plausible position to take than the skeptical alternative, what precisely are those reasons? It is only after we equip ourselves with a more fine-grained understanding of why one might be led to deny the existence of morality that we can be in a good position to judge whether one's confidence in the truth of moral realism is something that should grow weaker.</p>
    <p class="essay-paragraph">That's why we need to distinguish and examine a series of specific arguments, so as to properly understand and evaluate the specific concerns that might lead one to embrace moral skepticism ( or, at a minimum, leave one worried about the overall plausibility of realism ) .</p>
    <p class="essay-paragraph">Some of these arguments have aimed to show that nothing could actually have one or another of the features that anything worthy of being called morality would need to have. Consider, for example, arguments to the effect that there could be no such thing as moral knowledge, that moral beliefs couldn't properly motivate us, or that the very idea of a categorical reason is problematic. Other arguments claim to show only that moral realism is a less plausible hypothesis than moral skepticism is, given, for example, the presence of widespread moral disagreement, or realism's purported inability to offer an acceptable account of the metaphysics of moral properties.</p>
    <p class="essay-paragraph">All of these arguments come in various forms, or can be revised in response to initial replies on the part of the realist.</p>
    <p class="essay-paragraph">Of course, any given skeptic might not put forward all of these arguments, just as any given moral realist might not be troubled by all of these objections. But each of them represents a genuine and reasonable question to raise about morality, in the sense that each gives voice to a concern that might well occur to a thoughtful and open-minded person impartially reflecting on the legitimacy of believing in morality.</p>
    <p class="essay-paragraph">In each case, however, there are plausible answers available to the moral realist. Often enough, there is more than one possible answer ( though whether any given answer will be acceptable to any given realist may depend in part on what, exactly, the realist wants to include in the "job description" for morality ) . Sometimes, multiple alternative replies present themselves without requiring a choice among them. In other cases, however, certain particular answers strike philosophers as most plausible. And in still other cases, only a single answer seems uniquely promising.</p>
    <p class="essay-paragraph">Specific Refutations of Skeptical Arguments</p>
    <p class="essay-paragraph">Contemporary moral realism has developed sophisticated responses to the major skeptical challenges. Consider several key areas where realists have successfully countered anti-realist arguments:</p>
    <p class="essay-paragraph">Against Noncognitivism: Moral realists demonstrate that noncognitivist theories face serious difficulties. First, noncognitivism cannot adequately preserve ordinary moral truth talk and the diversity of moral predicates that we commonly use. When we say "torture is wrong," we appear to be making a truth claim, not merely expressing an attitude. Second, noncognitivism struggles to account for moral error in a satisfactory way. If moral judgments are merely expressions of attitudes, it becomes unclear how moral mistakes are possible. Third, noncognitivism cannot properly account for the normative questions we genuinely ask ourselves when deliberating about moral matters. These questions presuppose the existence of objective answers, not merely subjective preferences.</p>
    <p class="essay-paragraph">Against Constructivism: Constructivist theories face what philosophers call a fundamental dilemma. If the conditions for choosing the relevant attitudes that construct moral reality are themselves moralized, then the constructivist view becomes self-defeating, since moral standards independent from the construction procedure would be constraining its operation. But if these conditions are not moralized, then the resulting moral outputs may conflict with our most important moral convictions and established moral principles. This dilemma suggests that constructivism cannot provide a stable foundation for moral reality.</p>
    <p class="essay-paragraph">The Motivational Challenge: One major skeptical argument claims that moral realism is incompatible with the motivational force of moral judgments. This argument relies on two key premises: first, that there is a necessary connection between sincere moral judgments and motivation ( motivational judgment internalism ) , and second, that beliefs by themselves cannot motivate action ( motivational Humeanism ) . However, both premises can be successfully challenged.</p>
    <p class="essay-paragraph">Against motivational judgment internalism, we can point to conceptually possible cases of amoralists who make genuine moral judgments but lack corresponding motivation. Cases involving clinical depression, extreme apathy, or other psychological conditions demonstrate that the alleged necessary connection between moral judgment and motivation does not hold. Against motivational Humeanism, evaluative beliefs can indeed motivate action. When someone forms a belief about moral requirements based on available evidence, this belief can directly motivate behavior without requiring an additional desire.</p>
    <p class="essay-paragraph">The Causal Efficacy Problem: Skeptics argue that moral facts cannot be causally efficacious and therefore lack explanatory power. If moral properties are not identical to physical properties, how can they cause anything? Moral realists respond by adopting a causal inheritance principle: moral properties inherit the causal powers of their descriptive base properties. When a moral property like wrongness is instantiated through descriptive properties like causing unnecessary suffering, the moral property inherits the causal powers of those descriptive properties. While this leads to causal overdetermination, this form of overdetermination is not problematic when moral properties are constituted by causally efficacious descriptive phenomena.</p>
    <p class="essay-paragraph">The Reasons Internalism Challenge: Another skeptical argument connects moral obligations to individual motivational capacities through reasons internalism. This view holds that normative reasons must be capable of motivating the agent who has them. However, reasons internalism faces serious counterexamples. Some agents can be justly blamed or punished for evil deeds even when avoiding such conduct was rationally impossible for them given their psychological makeup. Disciplined immoralists, principled fanatics, and hardened misanthropes may lack the motivational capacity to respond to moral reasons, yet they remain genuinely subject to moral obligations and legitimate moral criticism.</p>
    <p class="essay-paragraph">Sometimes, providing a careful statement of a possible answer turns out to be a disappointingly complex affair. But even the simplest of questions can require complicated answers.</p>
    <p class="essay-paragraph">The crucial claim here is this: there are indeed plausible answers to each of the major skeptical arguments that philosophers have developed.</p>
    <p class="essay-paragraph">That's not to say, of course, that there is nothing more that the skeptic can say about any of these issues. There are further replies that could be made by the skeptic ( responses to responses, as it were, or, more accurately in many cases, responses to responses to responses to responses ) . Philosophical debates rarely come to an end; they mostly just get deeper, as each side tries to strengthen their arguments, sharpening and revising their objections and replies. So it should not be thought that anyone has said the last word on any of these topics. Indeed, philosophers working in moral philosophy already know of various ways in which each debate could easily be carried on for at least several more rounds.</p>
    <p class="essay-paragraph">However, enough has been shown to make it plausible to think that there is nothing intellectually disreputable about believing in morality. No one drawn to moral realism should think of themselves as being philosophically naive, as though it is just obvious that moral skepticism has the dialectical upper hand. On the contrary, the realist has the upper hand, and it is the moral skeptic, not the moral realist, who is in the argumentatively weaker position.</p>
    <p class="essay-paragraph">But even if this claim is wrong, it is far from being the case that any objective reviewer of the arguments on both sides would have to conclude that skepticism is in the obviously stronger position, as though it were much more likely to be true, or is clearly the more plausible of the two competing views. Even if moral realism doesn't have the better of the argument, we should agree, at a minimum, that it does not clearly have the worse of it. Skeptical arguments can be satisfactorily answered. But at the very least, there are answers to those arguments that are sufficiently plausible so that one needn't worry that believing in moral realism is somehow adopting a view that is philosophically dubious or shoddy.</p>
    <p class="essay-paragraph">There are, of course, still other skeptical arguments, different from the ones that have been analyzed here. But these discussions have not avoided the most compelling arguments for moral skepticism, presenting and criticizing only what anyone knowledgeable would immediately recognize as constituting the weaker portions of the skeptic's attack. On the contrary, the focus has been on the arguments that seem most plausible and difficult to respond to. ( The focus has also been on arguments that threaten moral realism broadly, rather than on ones that raise problems only for particular accounts of morality. )</p>
    <p class="essay-paragraph">Some of these arguments ( or some versions of these arguments ) are more "philosophical" than others, in that they may turn on abstract points that philosophers will be particularly concerned about. But arguments with wide intuitive appeal have been considered as well. In effect, the discussion has taken account of the main worries that should trouble thoughtful and reflective individuals. The skeptical misgivings that seem most important and worthy of attention have been laid out and addressed.</p>
    <p class="essay-paragraph">Thus, these arguments represent the deepest and most significant challenges to morality. So if, despite their initial appeal, they can be given plausible answers, then this goes very far indeed in suggesting that moral realism remains a defensible view.</p>
    <p class="essay-paragraph">Building Systematic Moral Theory</p>
    <p class="essay-paragraph">Suppose the various skeptical challenges to morality can all be answered ( if not decisively, at least satisfactorily ) . Where would that leave us? Would that show that the belief in morality is a justified one?</p>
    <p class="essay-paragraph">Not quite, or rather, not all by itself. For even if a variety of potential objections to morality are unsuccessful, that doesn't yet provide us with any positive reason to believe in morality. ( The lack of a compelling objection to a given view doesn't tell us whether we have any reason at all to accept that view. ) So it might seem that we still need to ask, is there indeed any positive justification for believing that morality exists? Or should we, instead, declare the matter a standoff, with no compelling arguments on either side?</p>
    <p class="essay-paragraph">In fact, however, there is indeed a prima facie justification for thinking that there really is such a thing as morality, that there really are objective moral truths. For we all have intuitions about an endless array of moral matters. It seems to us that certain actions are right or wrong, morally required or morally forbidden. It seems to us that certain states of affairs are intrinsically good, while others are intrinsically bad. It seems to us that some character traits are virtuous while others are vicious.</p>
    <p class="essay-paragraph">We have intuitions about rights, justice, promise keeping, and lies; about consent, self-defense, inequality, and compassion; about harm, fairness, self-respect, and gratitude. We have intuitions about the moral status of particular actions, in real and in imaginary cases, intuitions about the moral relevance of various factors, and how they weigh against one another, intuitions about general principles and potential exceptions to those principles. We have intuitions about all of these matters and a great deal more besides. And each one of these intuitions is a piece of evidence, a prima facie reason to believe that there are indeed moral facts, that there is a way things are, morally speaking. In short, that there is such a thing as morality.</p>
    <p class="essay-paragraph">To be sure, the justification provided by all these intuitions is defeasible. Had we discovered compelling reason to think that there simply could not be such a thing as morality, then we would have had no choice but to conclude that our intuitions are mistaken and that the moral facts seemingly revealed by intuition are all phantasms and illusions. But if the various skeptical challenges to morality are unsuccessful, then we do not yet have reason to doubt that things really are, on the whole, more or less as they appear to be.</p>
    <p class="essay-paragraph">Admittedly, any given intuition may yet be proven wrong or unreliable ( just as any given empirical observation can be in error ) , and conceivably we might yet discover reason to be suspicious of entire classes or particular types of moral intuitions ( just as we are rightly suspicious of empirical observations made while inebriated ) . But none of this will give us reason to reject wholesale the evidence provided by moral intuitions, that there are indeed moral facts, facts whose nature we can study and investigate.</p>
    <p class="essay-paragraph">So epistemically speaking, it isn't a standoff at all. We have striking evidence for the existence of morality, and while in principle the force of that evidence could have been undermined or defeated, we have no compelling reason to think that this is the case. We are left, then, with the evidence of our intuitions, which constantly attest to the existence of moral facts. We are, therefore, justified in believing there is indeed an objective moral reality, captured in the various moral truths revealed by those intuitions.</p>
    <p class="essay-paragraph">Accordingly, the moral realist is in a dialectically stronger position than the moral skeptic. Since it seems to us that there are moral facts, we are justified in believing that there are such facts, unless the skeptic can convince us that these intuitions are misleading us. Thus the burden of proof is on the skeptic to show us either that there cannot be such a thing as morality, or that belief in morality is a significantly less plausible hypothesis than its denial. If the skeptic hasn't come close to doing either one of these, then it remains more plausible, on balance, to hold that the various moral appearances really do justify our belief in a corresponding moral reality.</p>
    <p class="essay-paragraph">There is, however, one final way in which moral skepticism could conceivably be established. Imagine that it turned out to be impossible to construct a systematic moral theory, that there was no way to combine our various moral intuitions into a coherent overall picture of a corresponding moral domain. Then we would have good reason to believe that our intuitions were illusory after all, akin to dreams or hallucinations in that they could no longer be taken to ( directly ) reveal anything about reality. If we could not turn our moral intuitions into moral theory, then perhaps the best explanation would be that this is because there are no moral facts after all, no moral truths waiting to be systematically described.</p>
    <p class="essay-paragraph">The situation here would thus be similar to what we would have had to conclude had we found that it was impossible to use our various empirical observations to form a coherent overall theory of the external world, one which vindicates and supports many ( though not all ) of those very observations. What we find, of course, is that we are in fact able to offer such a picture, a picture of a world with people and things moving around in space and time, causally interacting with one another in countless ways.</p>
    <p class="essay-paragraph">Crucially, this is a picture that not only hangs together, it is a picture which largely ( though not totally ) vindicates the observations we used to construct that very picture. But imagine that it had been impossible to construct a systematic theory of an external world that corresponded to and matched ( the bulk of ) our observations. Then we would have had to dismiss the belief in an external world as an illusion, and our observations of it mere hallucinations. Indeed, this is precisely what we do with the "observations" made during dreams, and this is the reason we dismiss the "dream world" as an illusion: things certainly seem to us to be various ways when we are dreaming, but since there is no way to combine these various seemings into an overall systematic picture of a corresponding "dream reality," we rightly deny the very existence of a genuine dream world.</p>
    <p class="essay-paragraph">Suppose then that something like this had happened when we began to move from our various particular moral intuitions as well. Imagine that although we are all bombarded by a panoply of moral appearances, we had discovered that there was simply no way to combine those appearances into a picture of a moral domain that hung together coherently and that could be described systematically. Imagine that despite our best attempts to describe moral facts in a systematic fashion, we always came up short, so that every attempt to describe this apparent moral reality was invariably fragmented and incoherent, where each attempt forced us to dismiss the vast bulk of our moral intuitions as failing to correspond to anything real.</p>
    <p class="essay-paragraph">If we had found ourselves in such an unhappy situation, then here too we would ultimately have had to conclude that moral intuitions are illusions after all, that "moral facts" are no more real than "dream facts. "</p>
    <p class="essay-paragraph">But to concede all of this ( to concede that morality would be justifiably rejected as an illusion if it could not be coherently described in a way that also vindicated most though not all of our moral intuitions ) is not, of course, to suggest that we do indeed find ourselves in this situation. Just as most of us have a rough, commonsense theory of the external world, one which upholds as accurate most though not all of our observations ( this is a world with rocks and trees, people and clouds ) , most of us have a rough, commonsense theory of the moral world as well, one which upholds most though not all of our moral intuitions: this is a world with rights and duties, virtues and vices.</p>
    <p class="essay-paragraph">And just as the commonsense picture of the world is one that can be refined, modified, and improved upon, thanks to the systematic reflections that constitute the natural sciences, our picture of the moral world can be refined as well, modified and improved upon, through the systematic reflection that constitutes moral philosophy.</p>
    <p class="essay-paragraph">Epistemological Foundations</p>
    <p class="essay-paragraph">The case for moral realism receives additional support from developments in moral epistemology. A hybrid approach combines self-evident foundationalism for moral principles with process reliabilism for particular moral judgments. Some basic moral principles can be justified through adequate understanding and attentive consideration alone. When we properly grasp principles like "unnecessary suffering is wrong" or "promise-breaking requires justification," their truth becomes apparent through careful reflection.</p>
    <p class="essay-paragraph">For particular moral judgments about specific actions and character traits, reliable cognitive processes can generate justified beliefs. These processes take empirical beliefs about descriptive facts as inputs and produce moral verdicts as outputs. When functioning properly, our moral judgment faculties can track moral reality just as our perceptual faculties track physical reality.</p>
    <p class="essay-paragraph">The Metaphysical Picture</p>
    <p class="essay-paragraph">Contemporary moral realism embraces a nonreductive nonnaturalist metaphysics. Moral properties exist objectively but are not identical to scientifically legitimate properties. Instead, moral properties are constituted by, but not reducible to, descriptive properties. This view accommodates both the objectivity of moral facts and their distinctive normative character.</p>
    <p class="essay-paragraph">This metaphysical framework explains why moral obligations are intrinsically reason-giving in ways that purely descriptive properties are not. Moral standards function as devices for specifying oughts, which distinguishes them from descriptive scientific laws. The nonnaturalist position preserves the distinctive authority of moral requirements while maintaining their objective reality.</p>
    <p class="essay-paragraph">What does this systematic reflection reveal about the exact contents and basis of morality? What is it, exactly, that we are obligated to do? What do we actually owe to one another, and why? These are questions that would require immersion in the ongoing debates of normative ethics to fully answer.</p>
    <p class="essay-paragraph">But this much we can say based on the arguments examined: these are questions we are justified in approaching in the same way we would approach any other vitally important questions: with our minds open, looking for objective answers. The skeptical challenges to moral realism, while initially compelling, can be met with sophisticated philosophical responses that preserve both the objectivity and practical significance of moral truth.</p>
